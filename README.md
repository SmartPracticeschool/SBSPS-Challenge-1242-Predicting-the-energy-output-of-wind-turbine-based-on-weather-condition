# SBSPS-Challenge-1242-Predicting-the-energy-output-of-wind-turbine-based-on-weather-condition

## Problem Statement
Predicting the energy output of wind turbine based on weather condition
## Description
Wind energy plays an increasing role in the supply of energy world-wide.
The energy output of a wind farm is highly dependent on the wind conditions present at its site.
If the output can be predicted more accurately, energy suppliers can coordinate the collaborative production 
of different energy sources more efficiently to avoid costly overproduction.
